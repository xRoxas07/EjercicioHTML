        What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br> 
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br> 
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br>
        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br>
        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br>
        Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br> 
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        Where does it come from?</h2>

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply <br> 
        random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin <br> 
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <br> 
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden <br> 
        -Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more <br> 
        obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br> 
        passage, and going through the cites of the word in <br> 
        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <br> 
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of <br> 
        "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good <br> 
        and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a <br> 
        treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the <br> 
        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum <br> 
        dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since <br> 
        the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections <br> 
        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et <br>
        Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact <br> 
        original form, accompanied by English versions from the <br> 
        1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

        Why do we use it?</h2>
    <p style="background-color: chocolate; color: coral; font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; border-radius: 10px;

        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted <br>
        by the readable content of a page when looking at its <br>
        layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a <br>
        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br>
        using 'Content here, content here', making it look like <br> 
        readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and <br>
        web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default <br>
        model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover <br> 
        many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions <br> 
        have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br> 
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
    
    <h2 style="background-color: steelblue; color: blue; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;border-radius: 10px">
        Where can I get some?</h2>
    <p style="background-color: steelblue; color:blue; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 30px; padding: 50px;">
        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum <br> 
        available, but the majority have suffered alteration in <br> 
        some form, by injected humour, or randomised words <br> 
        which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going <br> 
        to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure <br> 
        there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of <br> 
        text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend <br> 
        to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this <br> 
        the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a <br> 
        dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a <br> 
        handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem <br> 
        Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem <br> 
        Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected <br> 
        humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
